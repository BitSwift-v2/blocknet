## Blocknet-Routing-Protocol
-- RIP/OSPF Style protocol for blockchain gateway nodes
-- Gateway Nodes broadcast the chain's ID (btc/ltc/etc)
-- Client nodes maintain tables
-- Client nodes will submit a request to N+ nodes
-- gateway nodes respond back w/ HASH of data
-- client node will compare hash to verify
-- client can then get data from N+ nodes and can hash/compare
